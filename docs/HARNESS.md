# Hedera Harness reference

The inherited generation and repair CLI remains available in Hedera Lab.
These instructions describe that foundation; start with the [project README](../README.md)
for Lab scenarios and paid verification.


TypeScript CLI that builds features into [scaffold-hbar](https://github.com/hedera-dev/scaffold-hbar) projects from a product brief you write. It drives a coding agent, validates what the agent produced, and repairs on failure — recording everything on a git branch you can review.

**The harness decides whether a run passed, not the agent.**

```bash
npx hedera-harness init my-app     # or run `init` inside a project you already have
cd my-app
$EDITOR .harness/prd.md            # describe the feature
npx hedera-harness doctor          # check the setup before a long run
npx hedera-harness run
```

## Hedera Lab: executable transaction scenarios

Lab provisions fresh accounts, NFT tokens, and consensus topics; drives your app
in Chromium; verifies ledger outcomes; and feeds failures into the agent repair loop.
Use simulated fixtures without credentials, or an SDK-backed local/testnet network.
Every run writes an HTML timeline and JSON evidence, labeled with the backend used.

```bash
# From this repository: no network or browser needed for this scenario
npm ci && npm run build
node dist/index.js lab run examples/lab-ticketing/scenarios/ledger.yaml

# Complete browser example
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run lab:demo
```

Enable scenarios in a recipe with `lab: { scenarios: [scenarios/purchase.yaml] }`.
Scenario contracts are captured before generation; modifying a contract fails the
gate. See the [Lab guide](../docs/lab/README.md), [ticketing example](../examples/lab-ticketing),
and [measured results](results.md), including real coding-agent experiments.

## How a run works

Each attempt runs four stages. Early stages short-circuit the rest, so a failing build never pays for a browser or an agent.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  inputs[Recipe: spec + PRD + validators] --> branch[Create or continue harness/run-* branch]
  branch --> baseline[Baseline health checks on the existing app]
  baseline --> generate[1 GENERATE - coding agent]
  generate --> assert[2 ASSERT - files, static, secrets, commands]
  assert --> smoke[3 SMOKE - dev server + Playwright routes]
  smoke --> evaluate[4 EVALUATE - adversarial validator vs contract]
  evaluate --> outcome[Pass / Fail / Abort]
  outcome --> artifacts[.harness/runs/ artifacts + checkpoint commits]
  assert -.->|fail + attempts left| generate
  smoke -.->|fail + attempts left| generate
  evaluate -.->|fail + attempts left| generate
```

- **fail + attempts left** → focused repair prompt → back to GENERATE
- **fail + budget exhausted** → stay on the harness branch with artifacts
- **harness/tooling failure** (MCP, browser) → **abort**, no repair — the app is not what broke

Every attempt reports what moved, not just pass/fail:

```
Stage 1/4 GENERATE — repair, attempt 3 [opus, escalated — last attempt fixed nothing]
Attempt 3 FAILED — 2 open, 3 fixed, 1 new
```

`2 open, 3 fixed` distinguishes an agent converging from one trading one failure for another — which is what tells you whether another attempt is worth its 15–40 minutes.

## The recipe

`.harness/` inside your project. Everything the harness can default, it defaults:

```yaml
schemaVersion: 2

name: my-feature
description: What you want the agent to build.

baseline:
  commands:
    - name: install          # required — also used for install fingerprinting
      command: yarn install
    - name: build
      command: yarn next:build
```

That is a complete, working recipe. `generator`, `logging`, `secretScan`, `forbiddenFiles`, validator paths, `prd` and `maxAttempts` all have defaults, and `constraints.forbiddenCommands` is derived from your package manager. The generated skeleton lists every default as a comment so you can see the full surface without carrying it.

Pick the agent with one line:

```yaml
agent: claude        # or: cursor (default)
```

That governs the whole run — how the generator is invoked, how the validator receives Playwright MCP, and which models are used. Enabling the semantic tier is then `validator: { enabled: true }`, not a second copy of the agent flags.

See [docs/authoring-a-recipe.md](../docs/authoring-a-recipe.md) for the full format.

### Building in increments

For anything larger than a small change, list PRDs in order:

```yaml
prd:
  - .harness/prds/01-foundation.md
  - .harness/prds/02-ui.md
  - .harness/prds/03-onchain.md
```

Each is delivered onto the same branch with its own attempt budget and its own checkpoint commits, and the agent is told which increment it is on and that the earlier ones are done. A failure stops the sequence; `--continue` resumes there rather than redoing delivered work.

One large PRD with three repair attempts is a poor fit for a real feature: the work exceeds the budget, and a failure loses all of it.

## Validation tiers

| Tier | Enable with | What it proves | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0–1 deterministic** | on by default | files present, static assertions, no secrets, build passes | seconds |
| **2 Playwright gate** | `validators.playwright` | the app boots and its routes actually render | a dev server boot |
| **3 semantic** | `contract` + `validator.enabled` | an adversarial agent drives the live app and grades numbered assertions | an agent session |
| **3.5 on-chain** | `chainValidation` | an ephemeral funded testnet signer completes real transactions, verified via mirror node | testnet HBAR |

Start at the bottom. Add a tier when the one below stops catching your failures.

The Tier 3 validator is told to **fail on uncertainty**. If it cannot reach the browser it says so and fails the assertion rather than guessing, so a passing verdict means something.

## Branch behaviour

| Current branch | Recipe | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `harness/run-feature-abc` | same | **continue** — resume attempts |
| `harness/run-feature-abc` | different | **new branch** |
| `main` or other | any | **new branch** |

```bash
hedera-harness run --new                                  # force a fresh branch
hedera-harness run --continue harness/run-my-feature-abc  # resume a specific one
```

The harness never pushes, opens a PR, merges, deletes a branch, or switches away. It requires a clean tree and does not auto-stash. Checkpoint commits stage explicit paths — never `git add -A` — and refuse to stage runtime or secret paths.

## CLI

```bash
hedera-harness init [dir] [--repo URL] [--ref branch] [--template name] [--skip-install] [--skills a,b]
hedera-harness run [spec] [--max-attempts N] [--new] [--continue <branch>]
hedera-harness doctor [spec] [--workspace <path>] [--recipe-only]
hedera-harness migrate [spec] [--dry-run]
hedera-harness validate [spec] [--workspace <path>]
hedera-harness validate-semantic [spec] [--workspace <path>]
```

**`init`** decides what to do from the target:

| Target | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| missing or empty | clone scaffold-hbar and provision `.harness/` |
| holds a `package.json` | adopt the harness in place, no clone |
| non-empty, not a project | refused |

`--template hedera-demo` selects a scaffold-hbar template branch. `init` never overwrites an existing recipe — it reports what it kept.

**`doctor`** reports everything at once instead of stopping at the first problem: node, git, git state, the recipe and its warnings, the agent CLI, the package manager, every path the recipe references, optional peer deps for the enabled tiers, and `chainValidation` env vars. A real run costs 40 minutes to two hours; this costs seconds.

**`migrate`** rewrites a pre-v2 recipe in place. A key is removed only when its value equals what the harness would default it to — anything you customised is kept and reported.

## Configuration

Operational knobs live in the environment, not the recipe. Editing a recipe to shorten a timeout produces a spurious project diff, and on a template branch it gets committed by mistake.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HARNESS_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | repair attempts per run |
| `HARNESS_AGENT_TIMEOUT_S` | wall-clock budget per agent invocation |
| `HARNESS_AGENT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | kill an agent that stops producing output |
| `HARNESS_MODEL` / `HARNESS_FIX_MODEL` | override the preset's models |
| `HARNESS_NO_MODEL_SWITCH` | disable dropping to a cheaper model on repairs |

Precedence: CLI flag > environment > recipe > harness default.

**Model escalation.** Repairs run the cheaper model, *except* after an attempt that fixed nothing — paying less to repeat a failure is not a saving, so it escalates back.

**Prompts are files.** Everything the agent is told lives in [`prompts/`](../prompts/) as markdown. Override any single one at `.harness/prompts/<name>.md`; `doctor` reports which are overridden, since an override is a copy that will not receive later changes.

## Prerequisites

**Always:** Node.js ≥ 20, git, and an authenticated agent CLI — Cursor (`agent`) or Claude Code (`claude`).

```bash
npm install -D hedera-harness
npx hedera-harness doctor
```

Playwright and the Hedera SDK are **optional peer dependencies**, needed only by the higher tiers:

```bash
# Tier 2 — the browser API; no separate Chromium download is required
npm install -D playwright

# Tier 3.5
npm install -D @hiero-ledger/sdk
export HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.xxxx
export HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY=0x...      # ECDSA — ED25519 has no EVM alias
```

**Tier 2 and Tier 3 share one browser policy.** The harness uses the project's
existing Playwright Chromium when available and otherwise launches system
Chrome. Tier 2 still needs the `playwright` package for its browser API, but
neither tier requires a separate Chromium download when Chrome is installed.
For Tier 3, the harness launches its pinned `@playwright/mcp` version through
`npx` and supplies the MCP configuration itself; do not copy an `.mcp.json`
into the project. Run `npx hedera-harness doctor` to launch-probe the selected
browser.

See [`.env.example`](../.env.example). The harness does not auto-load `.env`, and never writes credentials into the workspace.

## Project layout after `init`

```
my-app/
├── .harness/
│   ├── spec.yaml              # the recipe
│   ├── prd.md                 # what to build
│   ├── validators/

│   └── runs/                  # artifacts + session.json (gitignored)
├── skills-index.json
└── packages/
```

Harness logs always live under `.harness/runs/` and are not configurable — pointing them elsewhere would leave untracked files that fail the next run's clean-tree check.

## Skills

Recipes list skills by **name**. The harness resolves them through [`skills-index.json`](../skills-index.json), fetching from git when needed (cached under `.skill-cache/`) and vendoring into `.harness/runtime/skills/` for the run.

```yaml
skills:
  - hedera-consensus-service
  - project-scaffolding
```

To author recipes with an agent, install the marketplace plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add hedera-dev/hedera-skills
/plugin install hedera-harness
/create-harness-spec
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Clean and compile to `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting |
| `npm test` | Build, then run the Node test suites |
| `npm run check:templates` | Verify every scaffold-hbar template recipe still loads |
| `npm run smoke:pack` | Pack a tarball and smoke-install it with Yarn 3 |

## Design notes

- **Validation is authoritative** — agents do not declare success; the harness does.
- **Infrastructure failures are not app failures** — an MCP or browser problem aborts rather than handing the agent a repair prompt for something it did not break.
- **The project is the workspace** — one git worktree, versioned by `harness/run-*` branches and checkpoint commits.
- **Nothing is pushed for you** — completion prints the next steps and stops.
- **Secrets never reach artifacts** — prompts and logs are redacted, the ephemeral signer file is `0600`, and checkpoints refuse to stage secret paths.

### Negotiated independent verification

Hedera Lab now includes a verification service with customer-owned requirements,
quote/counteroffer negotiation, atomic spending reservations, x402 testnet payments
through Blocky402, and independent scenario evidence.

```sh
npm run verify:demo
npm run verify:serve
```

See [Verifier Exchange](../docs/verification/README.md) for the API, optional model
planner, real payment evidence, failure recovery, and deployment limitations.
