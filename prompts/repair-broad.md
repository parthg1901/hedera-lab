You are repairing a scaffold-hbar template in the current workspace.
This is a fresh-context repair attempt. You do not retain memory from prior agent runs.

Repair attempt: {{attempt}}
Repair scope: **broad** (structural and/or mixed validation failures).

## Read First (Workspace Memory)
Before changing anything, read these files in the current workspace:
- `{{prdPath}}` — product requirements
{{#hasContract}}
- `{{contractPath}}` — numbered acceptance assertions the validator will grade against
{{/hasContract}}
- `GENERATION_NOTES.md` — prior generator/repair notes (create it if missing)

## Repair Mission
Fix only the validation findings below. Do not redesign unrelated parts of the app.

{{#hasMetadata}}
## Template Metadata Targets
{{metadata}}
{{/hasMetadata}}

{{hardConstraints}}

{{#hasRequiredFiles}}
## Required Deliverables

## Validation Findings

{{#hasSemantic}}

## Failed Assertions (detail)

## Repair Rules
- Keep Yarn-only workflows.
- Do not add secrets or `.env` files.
- Preserve scaffold-hbar template conventions.
- Fix findings in priority order: [agent] process failures, [commands] build/lint, [playwright] runtime gate, [semantic] contract assertions, then [files]/[static]/[secret].
- Do NOT attempt to fix [semantic-infra] findings — those are harness/tooling failures (MCP/browser), not app defects.
- Re-run the relevant validation mentally before finishing.

Append a brief repair note to `GENERATION_NOTES.md` at the workspace root, describing what failed and what you changed.
- Do not read or write files outside the current workspace.

If the PRD restricts edits to specified files, do not create or edit notes outside that list; summarize your work in your final response instead.
