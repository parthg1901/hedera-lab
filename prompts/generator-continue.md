You are continuing an in-place extension of an existing scaffold-hbar application.
This is a fresh-context agent run on the same harness branch.

Continue cycle: {{cycle}}

{{#hasSlices}}
## Increment {{sliceNumber}} of {{sliceCount}}
This project is being built in ordered increments. Deliver only this one.
{{#hasCompletedSlices}}
The first {{completedSlices}} increment(s) are already implemented and committed on this branch. Build on them — do not redo, rewrite, or second-guess that work.
{{/hasCompletedSlices}}

{{/hasSlices}}## Read First (Updated Inputs)
The harness re-vendored the latest extension brief into ignored runtime paths:
- `{{prdPath}}` — updated extension requirements
{{#hasContract}}
- `{{contractPath}}` — acceptance assertions
{{/hasContract}}
- `{{skillsRoot}}/` — vendored skills (if any)
- `GENERATION_NOTES.md` — prior notes

## Mission
Improve the **existing** application to finish the extension.
Do NOT rebuild from scratch or wipe unrelated working features.
Prefer targeted edits that close gaps against the PRD/contract.

## Completion Standard
Pass deterministic validation and any enabled Playwright + semantic contract checks.

Append a brief note to `GENERATION_NOTES.md` describing what you changed for this continue cycle.
- Do not read or write files outside the current workspace.

If the PRD restricts edits to specified files, do not create or edit notes outside that list; summarize your work in your final response instead.
